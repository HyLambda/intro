  <!-- About Me Text -->
  <p>
    I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from Northwestern University. 
    My primary research interest lies at the interface of spectral geometry and dynamical systems, focusing on the spectral and dynamical invariants arising in inverse spectral theory.
    I studied under the late Steve Zelditch and later worked independently with partial guidance and morale support from Jared Wunsch
    and Elton Pei Hsu. The premise of my thesis and ongoing research endeavors centers on the spectral analysis of unitary operators
    within the framework of Koopman-von Neumann mechanics, exploring the connections between classical integrable systems,
    ergodic theory, and quantum mechanics.  
    A key aspect of this work involves studying the Koopman operator of geodesic flows on unit phase spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds and developing the associated inverse-spectral
    theoretic framework of the underlying geometries.

## Data Science/ML Projects

- **Sentiment Analysis and Stock Dynamics**:  
  A team-based data science research project where we gathered and analyzed text data from over 600+ news articles on the top 20 publicly-traded companies to assess market impact. Evaluated and ranked 4 predictive models (Sentiment Analysis - VADER, Linear Regression - LinReg, Spearman Correlation, and ARIMA/ARIMAX) in their forecasting performance on volatility parameters, including traded stock volume, high/low, and close prices.

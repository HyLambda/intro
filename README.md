I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from Northwestern University. My primary research interest lies at the interface of spectral geometric analysis and dynamical systems, focusing on the spectral and dynamical invariants arising in inverse spectral theory. I studied under the late Steve Zelditch and later worked independently with partial guidance and moral support from Jared Wunsch and Elton Pei Hsu. The premise of my thesis and ongoing research endeavors centers on the spectral analysis of unitary operators within the framework of Koopman-von Neumann mechanics, exploring the connections between classical integrable systems, ergodic theory, and quantum mechanics. A key aspect of this work involves studying the Koopman operator of geodesic flows on unit phase spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds and developing the associated inverse-spectral theoretic framework of the underlying geometries.

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), part of the deep-learning-focused research group led by Randy Paffenroth.

## Data Science/ML Projects

- **DTRA Spectral Modeling and Synthetic Data Generation**:
  A DTRA-supported applied mathematics + ML project focused on learning stable, physically grounded mappings between molecular structure, operating conditions, and measured instrument response (e.g., spectra). I lead the mathematical formulation-casting the pipeline as an inverse/operator theoretic problem, which then translate it into architectures and objectives that enforce invariances, identifiability, and out-of-regime generalization via hybrid physics–ML modeling and principled synthetic data/augmentation.
  - [Project Link](classified under NDA) classified under NDA


- **Sentiment Analysis and Stock Dynamics**:  
  A team-based data science research project where we gathered and analyzed text data from over 600+ news articles on the top 20 publicly-traded companies to assess market impact. Evaluated and ranked 4 predictive models (Sentiment Analysis - VADER, Linear Regression - LinReg, Spearman Correlation, and ARIMA/ARIMAX) in their forecasting performance on volatility parameters, including traded stock volume, high/low, and close prices.

  <!-- About Me Text -->
  <p>
    I am a mathematician with a strong interest in advancing my career in data science and machine learning.
    I studied under the late Steve Zelditch and later worked independently with partial guidance from Jared Wunsch
    and Elton P. Hsu at Northwestern University. My research focuses on the spectral analysis of unitary operators
    within the framework of Koopman-von Neumann mechanics, exploring the connections between classical integrable systems,
    ergodic theory and quantum mechanics.  
    A key aspect of this work involves studying the Koopman operator and developing the associated inverse spectral
    theory to determine the geometry of base manifolds.

## Data science/ML project(s)
- My team and I gathered and analyzed sentiment from over 600+ news articles on top 20 publicly-traded companies to assess market impact. Evaluated and ranked 4 predictive models (Sentiment analysis - VADER, Linear regression - LinReg, Spearsman correlation and ARIMA/ARIMAX) in their forecasting performance on volatility parameters including traded stock volume, high/low and close prices.

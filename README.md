  <!-- About Me Text -->
  <p>
    I am currently a PhD candidate at the Department of Mathematics, Northwestern University. 
    My primary research interest lies at the interface of spectral geometry and dynamical systems focusing on the spectral and dynamical invariants arising in inverse spectral theory.
    I studied under the late Steve Zelditch and later worked independently with partial guidance and morale support from Jared Wunsch
    and Elton Hsu at Northwestern University. The premise of my thesis and on-going research endeavors center on the spectral analysis of unitary operators
    within the framework of Koopman-von Neumann mechanics, exploring the connections between classical integrable systems,
    ergodic theory and quantum mechanics.  
    A key aspect of this work involves studying the Koopman operator of the geodesic flow on the unit phase space and developing the associated inverse spectral
    theory to determine the geometry of base manifolds.

## Directed reading project 
- I mentored advanced undergraduate students on topics related to dynamical systems, functional analysis, quantum theory 
  (most recent project discussed Hamiltonian mechanics).
  


## Data science/ML project(s)
- A team-based data science research project where we gathered and analyzed text data from over 600+ news articles on top 20 publicly-traded companies to assess market impact. Evaluated and ranked 4 predictive models (Sentiment analysis - VADER, Linear regression - LinReg, Spearsman correlation and ARIMA/ARIMAX) in their forecasting performance on volatility parameters including traded stock volume, high/low and close prices.

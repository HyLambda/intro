## About me 

I am a mathematician with a strong interest in advancing my career in quantum computation and machine learning.

I studied under the late Steve Zelditch and later worked independently with partial guidance from Jared Wunsch and Elton P. Hsu at Northwestern University. My research focuses on the spectral analysis of non-self-adjoint operators within the framework of Koopman-von Neumann mechanics, exploring the connections between 
classical ergodic theory and quantum mechanics. 
A key aspect of this work involves studying the Koopman operator and developing the associated inversespectral theory to determine the geometry of base manifolds.
